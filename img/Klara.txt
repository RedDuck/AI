Create a comics Czech woman in her early 30s, designed for an adventure visual novel. The character should be expressive and emotionally nuanced, with lifelike features, natural proportions, and detailed textures. The style should lean toward cinematic realism while still fitting the tone of a character-driven narrative game.

The character should always be shown from a front-facing angle, upper body visible (torso up), with detailed and dynamic facial expressions and body language that reflect each emotion.

Character Description (consistent across all variations):

Hair: Natural ginger red; long, wavy, and slightly messy, with realistic texture and movement

Eyes: Bright green, reflective and emotionally vivid

Skin: Fair complexion with a natural light dusting of freckles across cheeks and nose

Age: Early 30s

Ethnicity/Nationality: Czech (Central European facial features)

Overall Vibe: A charismatic, emotionally complex protagonist — the type of heroine you’d find in a mature, story-rich visual novel

Outfit:

Stylish, modern, and subtly seductive in a European chic way

A sleek leather jacket worn over a crop top

A fitted blouse with an open collar underneath or peeking through

Clothing should have realistic fabric folds, lighting, and texture that support her expression and posture

Generate six emotional variations of the same character (always front-facing, same physical traits):

Warm and Joyful
A natural, radiant smile lights up her face. Eyes crinkled softly at the corners, glowing with calm joy and kindness. Her posture is relaxed and open, with a gentle softness in her features — like someone savoring a quiet, beautiful moment.

Fearful and Shocked
Her eyes are wide with panic, pupils dilated. Eyebrows raised and tense, lips parted in a silent gasp. A subtle flush of fear drains her cheeks. Her body is stiff, shoulders slightly raised — frozen as if she just witnessed something terrifying.

Sad and Vulnerable
Her gaze is lowered or turned slightly away, with glossy eyes hinting at tears. Lips gently trembling in a frown, brows drawn together in quiet sorrow. One arm may cross her body, hand holding her opposite shoulder in a self-soothing gesture. She looks deeply affected — exposed and human.

Playful and Flirtatious
A sly, confident smirk plays on her lips. One eyebrow arches slightly, eyes half-lidded and glinting with mischief. Her posture is casual, leaning forward just a bit, as if about to say something witty. The energy is magnetic, flirtatious, and warm.

Nervous and Blushing
Visible blush spreads across her cheeks. Her eyes dart sideways, lips parted in an awkward smile. Her posture is slightly withdrawn, shoulders raised subtly. One hand may be nervously toying with her hair or adjusting her collar. Her whole body language radiates tension and charm.

Angered and Defiant
Her green eyes are narrowed in a sharp, unyielding glare. Brows are furrowed, jaw clenched. Her lips form a tight line or a defiant snarl. Shoulders are squared and her chest slightly forward — confident and unafraid. One hand might be clenched into a fist. She radiates strength and inner fire.
